Web scraped data of 10k Play Store apps for analysing the Android market.

For the weekly Project our team decided to look into Google Play App Store Data.
This project is to help and improve our ability to get ourselves more familiar with the manipulation of  data and Web Scraping. 

We will gather the data from kaggle.com and the Metadata will be extracted from Lavanya Gupta (https://www.kaggle.com/lava18).

The mentioned project has used Python, Javascript, and Matplotlib.

Our team goal is to reach the same results reached by the original research.

</p>
Selecting a topic 	
Finding a data set	
Finding inspiration	
“Sketching” your ideal visuals
Creating a 1-page proposal

## Day 2: 
### You will need to create a 1-page proposal that includes:
A brief articulation of your chosen topic and rationale
A link to your data set(s) and a screenshot of the metadata if it exists.	
3 or 4 screenshots of relevant, “inspiring” visualizations that frame your creative fodder	
A sketch of the final design 	
A link to the primary GitHub repository you’ll be housing your work in

## Day 3:
### Project Work

# Specific Requirements

1. Your visualization must include a Python Flask–powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). 

2. Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks: 
    * A custom “creative” D3.js project (i.e., a nonstandard graph or chart)
    * A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
    * A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
    * A “thick” server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)
    
    3. Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
    
    4. Your project must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records.
    
    5. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
    
    6. Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.
